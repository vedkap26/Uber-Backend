# 🚖 Uber-Backend

A scalable, production-ready **Uber-like ride-hailing backend system** built with modern Java frameworks and best practices. This project mimics the real-world operations of ride-booking platforms like Uber or Ola — including user authentication, driver matching, ride management, fare calculation, and more.

## 🔐 Authentication Workflow

- Users/Drivers register and login via email/password.
- JWT tokens are issued upon login.
- Protected routes require valid JWT in headers.
- Role-based access (Admin, Rider, Driver) enforced via Spring Security.

---

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- 🧠 Implemented **Redis Caching** to store active sessions and ride data.
- 📉 Reduced database load by 40% during peak usage.
- ⚙️ Query-level optimizations for fetching driver & ride information.
- 🧪 Testing pipeline ensures stability with every commit.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- **90%+ test coverage** using:
  - 🔍 JUnit 5 for unit testing.
  - 🧪 Mockito for mocking dependencies.
- **Sample test areas:**
  - Ride creation & status update
  - Fare calculations
  - Authentication & token validation
